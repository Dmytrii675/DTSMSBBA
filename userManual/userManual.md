2. **Connect the Voltage Sensor**: Connect the voltage sensor to another analog input pin on the Arduino.
3. **Connect the Relay Module**: Connect the relay module to a digital output pin on the Arduino.
4. **Power the Arduino**: Ensure the Arduino is powered via USB or an external power source.

### Software Setup
1. **Install Visual Studio Code**: Download and install Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Install PlatformIO Extension**: In Visual Studio Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking the square icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`, and search for "PlatformIO IDE". Install the PlatformIO IDE extension.
3. **Install Wokwi Extension**: In Visual Studio Code, search for "Wokwi Arduino Simulator" in the Extensions view and install it.
4. **Clone the Project Repository**: Clone the project repository from your version control system (e.g., GitHub) into your local machine.
5. **Open the Project**: Open the cloned project directory in Visual Studio Code.
6. **Configure PlatformIO**: Ensure that the `platformio.ini` file is properly configured with the correct environment and board settings for your Arduino model.
7. **Run the Simulation**: Use the Wokwi extension to simulate the Arduino project and verify the system's functionality.
8. **Upload Code**: Once verified, use PlatformIO to upload the code to your Arduino board by clicking the upload button in the PlatformIO toolbar.

### Running the System
1. **Start the System**: Power on the Arduino and the connected sensors.
2. **Monitor the Status**: Use the Arduino Serial Monitor in Visual Studio Code to view real-time temperature and voltage readings.
3. **Manage Alerts**: The system will automatically manage and disconnect third-party devices if critical conditions are detected.

## Functional Requirements

### Temperature Monitoring
- The system continuously monitors the battery temperature.
- **Low Temperature**: When the temperature is below a safe threshold, the system operates normally.
- **Medium Temperature**: When the temperature reaches a warning level, the system alerts the user.
- **Critical Temperature**: When the temperature exceeds the critical threshold, the system disconnects third-party devices to prevent damage.

### Voltage Monitoring
- The system continuously monitors the battery voltage.
- **Voltage Thresholds**: The system manages devices based on predefined voltage thresholds to ensure safe operation.

### Device Management
- **Relay Control**: The system uses a relay module to connect and disconnect third-party devices based on temperature and voltage conditions.
- **Priority Management**: Devices are managed based on their priority levels to ensure critical devices remain operational as long as possible.

## Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Periodically check connections and sensor readings to ensure accurate monitoring.
- Clean the sensors and Arduino board to prevent dust and debris accumulation.

### Software Updates
- Update the Arduino code as needed to incorporate new features or improve performance.
- Ensure that all libraries are up to date in Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO.

## Troubleshooting
### Support
- For further assistance, refer to the official Arduino documentation, Visual Studio Code documentation, or community forums.
